RubyGram !

This is just a small application I made to get me motivated/started into programing (as well as learning ruby!)

I've been tinkering for years trying to really break into it but have 'failed' a lot in getting serious about it until recently.

Anyway.. what this does is just a small script (that's now OO like) that prompts a user for a word and then submits the HTTP request to wordsmith.com's anagram finder. It then gets the results and parses them out and presents them to the user.

You will notice in obtaining the web page I use raw sockets and HTTP/1.1 commands to do this. You will also notice I parse the result with a method that contains a complicated/tokenized regex. I did this as a learning exercise and I prefer to do things manually when I can.. so i fully grasp what's happening underneath everything. The regex I got a lot of help with from the great folks in #regex on freenode as well as #regex on EfNet.

To run:
	1.	Place ana-class.rb and main.rb in the same directory
	2. 	From the command line, type "ruby main.rb"
	3.	Enjoy!
